# Gemini-esp32
Code to use the ESP32 to Interact with Google Gemini but "smaller" the idea is to have an AI on as many platforms as possible without having the worry of not having enough resources to run it locally (in the future perhaps use the capabilities of the ESP32 together with Gemini to create more complex projects)
