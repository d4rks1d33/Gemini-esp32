# Gemini-esp32
Code to use the ESP32 to Interact with Google Gemini but "smaller" the idea is to have an AI on as many platforms as possible without having the worry of not having enough resources to run it locally (in the future perhaps use the capabilities of the ESP32 together with Gemini to create more complex projects)


You need to place here your Gemini Api Key (Is free to get using this link: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key?hl=es-419 You only need a Gmail account)

---->  const char* apiKey = "Your Api Key Here";  <----

~~Flipper Zero app (Gemini IA.js)~~ Moved to Gemini-Flipper repo


To do:

--> ~~Store the Api Key in a file inside of the flipper zero instead of flashing it inside of the esp32~~

--> ~~Remember Wi-Fi to avoid entering the password every time~~
