# Gemini-esp32
Code to use the ESP32 to Interact with Google Gemini but "smaller" the idea is to have an AI on as many platforms as possible without having the worry of not having enough resources to run it locally (in the future perhaps use the capabilities of the ESP32 together with Gemini to create more complex projects)


You need to place here your Gemini Api Key (Is free to get using this link: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key You only need a Gmail account)

---->  const char* apiKey = "Your Api Key Here";  <----

Regarding to the apiKey is not needed to add in the code if you are planning to use this firmware with the Flipper Zero app

~~Flipper Zero app (Gemini IA.js)~~ Moved to Gemini-Flipper repo
